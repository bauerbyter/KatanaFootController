# Katana FootController
### Work still in Progress - Code still messy 
This is an approach for an simple USB Controller for the Katana to replace and expand the GA FC.
It is possibel to config every switch to whatever function you like.

At the moment this is just for the MK2 (mkii), but its easy changeable to MK1 (mki).

To be very clear: I just adapted code from other people and just wrote some little code around it to fit my needs. Thanks a lot to the guys from VGuitar Forum and these github repos.
